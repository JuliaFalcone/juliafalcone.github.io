However, not everyone may be as familiar with how to data from SDSS and use Google Sheets, so this post is an attempt to be as explicit about these steps so that anyone, regardless of their familiarity with these processes, can still benefit from them."

I have circled in red all the options which must be manually changed to get the desired query."
