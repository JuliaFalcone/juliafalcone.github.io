<h1 style="text-align: center; "><strong>Summary</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;">We perform a multiwavelength (optical, near-IR, and radio) analysis of the AGN-driven outflows and feedback processes in NGC 3227. </span></li>
<br>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;">We determine a new orientation for the biconical structure along which outflows propagate away from the AGN. </span></li>
<br>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px;">We find that the ionized outflows are launched from within 20 pc of the SMBH, and gas starts decelerating at a distance of 26 &plusmn; 6 pc from the AGN. </span></li>
</ul>

      <td style="width:60%; padding-right:20px;"">
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-align: justify;">The process of accretion to an AGN can result in the expulsion of large amounts of radiation, which can push on the surrounding gas and drive it outwards. This drives a complex series of processes and interactions between the SMBH and its host galaxy that we broadly refer to as AGN feedback. This paper is a study of the AGN feedback processes in NGC 3227, which is a Seyfert 1 galaxy located at a distance of 23.7 Mpc. It has a dwarf elliptical companion, NGC 3226, with whom it&rsquo;s tidally interacting.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400; padding-right:20px;">This study focuses on characterizing the high-velocity outflowing gas that is frequently observed in feedback processes. By doing so, we also aim to develop an updated model for the biconical geometry along which the outflows travel, which will be essential towards better understanding how the feedback process operates in this galaxy.</span></p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). We used data generously supplied by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...628A..65A/abstract">Alonso-Herrero et al.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use a Bayesian algorithm called BEAT (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...834...30F/abstract">Fischer et al. 2017</a>) to fit multiple Gaussian profiles to one-dimensional spectra extracted from the two-dimensional data. We were able to fit both the narrow and broad emission lines, which increased the accuracy of our fits. An example of our fits are shown below. On the left, we fit Hβ; and the [O III] 5007/4959 doublet; on the right, we fit H&alpha; and the [N II] 6583/6548 doublet. Fitting these lines will provide us with crucial information about how the gas is moving (for example, whether it's redshifted or blueshifted relative to the rest frame of the galaxy), and how bright the region is. </span></p>
<img src="beat fits.png" width=900px class="center90">
<p>Notice above how this fit includes a mix of broad (olive) and narrow (teal, red, and orange) curves. If we take the plot on the left, we see that Hβ is fit with a broad component, but all three emission lines are each fit with two narrow components (that's the red and teal curves that you see under Hβ and both [O III] lines). Each narrow-line component is representative of a cloud or knot of gas moving at a distinct velocity, so the observation of two narrow-line components for this spectrum implies that at this specific location, the spectrograph has picked up the existence of two knots. </p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What did we find?<br /></strong></h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successfully implementing BEAT to fit our data yields kinematic plots such as the one seen below, which reveals the H&alpha; velocities for a KOSMOS slit. The red, blue, and green colors are representative of the first, second, and third Gaussian components that were fit to the data. Not all fits have second or third components, based on the output from BEAT. The black curve shows the rotation curve for NGC 3227 (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470..992R/abstract">Riffel et al. 2017</a>), so significant deviations from this curve, such as the data extending to -500 km/s at 5&rdquo; (~600 pc), show evidence of outflows.</span></p>


<img src="KOSMOS kinematics.png" width="700px" class="center70">







<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We also produce plots showing the Gaussian line widths and integrated flux values as a function of distance, shown in the middle and bottom rows of the figure above, which help us futher analyze the gas motions. Similar kinematic analyses were performed on the rest of the spectra to better understand how gasses at these various phases move in relation to each other.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also use these kinematics to better define the orientation of the bicone, which constrains the direction of the outflowing gas away from the AGN. With input parameters for the bicone like inclination and half-opening angle, we can model the bicone and estimate the range of velocities we would expect to see at a given distance. We assume a linear acceleration and deceleration for the radiated gas, and define the model&rsquo;s turnover radius as the distance where the latter overtakes the former, and is visually represented in the models as the distances where the velocities peak.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Radiative Driving</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We assume that two processes govern the motion of gas away from the AGN: radiative pressure from the enormous amounts of energy pushing outwards in the form of AGN-induced radiative acceleration; and gravitational deceleration from the enclosed mass in the host galaxy (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...543..686P/abstract">Proga et al. 2000</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.419L..64R/abstract">Ram&iacute;rez &amp; Tombesi 2012</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916...31M/abstract">Meena et al. 2021</a>). Under this formalism, we utilize a relationship that charts the trajectories of gas as a function of the distance from the SMBH from where the gas was launched.  </span></strong></p>

      <th style="width:50%; padding-right:20px;">
         <p><span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 14px; text-align: center; ">Looking at the graph below, we can see that gas which is launched from within the innermost few parsecs of the SMBH travel farther and faster than gas launched ffrom distances of 10 or 20 pc. Therefore, using our kinematic data from KOSMOS, we can deduce launch distances for this gas: these knots, at current distances of 30 &ndash; 600 pc (marked by the red dots), can be tracked back to launch radii of 2 - 20 pc. In the graph below, the turnover radius where deceleration overtakes acceleration occurs at 31 pc. We compare this observational turnover radius to the one we calculate from our bicone model, which has been previously studied in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...943...98M/abstract">Meena et al.
