											Hello! I'm Julia Falcone, a PhD Candidate in Astronomy at Georgia State University. I have been at GSU since Fall 2020, and I work with Professor Mike Crenshaw on active galactic nuclei (AGN) outflows and feedback processes. You can read more about my research work below! 
								<br>
								<br>
								In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, knitting, taking walks, and sewing. I am also passionate about issues related to labor justice, especially as it concerns chronically and systemically low wages for graduate students in all fields of academia. As the graduate student represenative at the Physics and Astronomy Department's faculty meetings and the College of Arts and Sciences' Graduate Council meetings, and I have continually advocated for graduate students to recieve fair compensation and treatment. If you are interested in communicating further about this topic and how we have managed to secure some victories, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Feel free to shoot me an email at <b>jfalcone2 [at] gsu.edu</b> !

									</div> -->
									<div>
<p> <figure class="image right"> <img src="paper_1_summary/bicone model.png" width = 350 /> <figcaption> Looking towards the center of NGC 3227, we see signatures of ionized [O III] emission, shown here as contours in the foreground. This figure shows the orientation of the biconical structure, along which this emission moves in the form of NLR outflows. The blue and red shaded regions show the near and far parts of the cone, respectively. The gray disk represents the plane of the galaxy, which bisects the cone. Developing a method to best determine the orientation of NLR bicones has been one of the central focuses of my research. </figcaption> </figure> 

At the center of every galaxy is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that can have the mass of over 1 billion Suns. An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a supermassive black hole that is actively feeding from an accretion disk rotating at very high speeds around it. As material is falling from the accretion disk into the SMBH, enormous amounts of radiation is released, which is often bright enough to rival the luminosity of the entire galaxy. This radiation both ionizes the gas in the surrounding narrow-line region (NLR) and pushes it away from the SMBH, creating a feedback process in the form of AGN outflows. I study the kinematics of the ionized, near-IR, and molecular outflows in the galaxy NGC 3227 to further understand the interplay between these outflows and the host galaxy.

	<br>
	<br>


Some of the techniques I use in my research involve the reduction and analysis of the Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph (KOSMOS) at Apache Point Observatory (APO), where I currently have over 150 hours of observing experience. I have significant experience with spectral fitting analysis, and have been contributing to a Gaussian fitting routine called <a href="https://github.com/dzhuliya/keeping-the-BEAT">BEAT</a> since 2023. I currently help maintain the documentation.

<!--been involved in testing a Gaussian fitting routine called BEAT (see <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...834...30F/abstract">Fischer et al. 2017</a>) to fit our spectra, and have made significant improvements to another fitting routine that utilizes BEAT to create self-consistent spectral fits across the visible spectrum. Specifically, I have implemented a method in the latter routine to fit Seyfert 1 spectra, which contain characteristic broad emission at Balmer line wavelengths.

Another contribution that I have made in my research is the development of an algorithm that determines the most likely orientation of a given AGN's outflows. -->

<br>
<b>My first paper</b> was published in Summer 2024. It focuses on characterizing the kinematics of the ionized, warm molecular, and cold molecular gas observations for NGC 3227, which results in the determination of the biconical outflow orienation (pictured in the figure above) and a velocity law for the ionized outflows. You can find the link <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad5283">here</a>, or you can read my summary of it <a href="paper_1_summary/paper1_summary.html">here</a>. I was also invited to speak about my paper on the <i>Starts With a Bang</i> podcast, and you can listen to that <a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/starts-with-a-bang-podcast-109-launching-a-galactic-cone/">here</a>. 

<br>
<br>

<b>My second study</b> is an expansion of the first, still focusing on the outflows in NGC 3227. In this work, we quantify spatially-resolved mass outflow rates in three gas phases (cold molecular, warm molecular, and ionized) and apply it to the molecular gas reservoirs around the SMBH to estimate the evacuation timescales of the reservoirs. This study was published in January 2026 and you can read it <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae1c3b">here</a>.

											and passive elliptical galaxies isn't well understood. Since 2016, I have
										been studying this elusive transitory phase by searching through the Sloan Digital
									Sky Survey (SDSS) to identify E+A galaxies. These galaxies are characterized by an era of
									starburst followed by sudden and total quenching within the last gigayear,
									and are thought to be the rare middle piece in this transition. In particular, my group is
								interested in nearby galaxy clusters (namely Virgo, Coma, and Leo),
							and the noteworthy prevalence of E+As within them. By studying these galaxies, we hope to learn more about the impact
						of cluster environments on galaxy evolution. </p>

				<!--					In the fall of 2018, my two friends and I-- the only three girls majoring in Physics in our year--
								decided to create the Women in Physics and Astronomy Club at Case Western. We were inspired to
							do so out of a need for a stronger support system as we battled impostor syndrome and casual sexism in our physics classes.
						As the club's president until graduation, I planned a myriad of events for students of all genders, including lectures by
					woman-aligned physics and astronomy professors, graduate student panels, and a resume/CV workshop.
				As a club, we even ventured to Pittsburgh for the 2019 Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics,
			which was a blast!-->

			Since the summer of 2021, I have been a Graduate Lead in the Georgia Outreach Team for Space (or <a href="https://gasgc.org/wp/gotspace/">GOT Space</a>), an outreach program affiliated with the Georgia Space Grant Consortium, the National Science Foundation, Georgia Institute of Technology, and a few other universities. As a lead organizer, some of my responsibilities include coordinating outreach events with educators, partaking in outreach events (which you can see in the image on the left!), and overseeing the content to be presented at outreach events. In 2024, GOT Space launched <a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/atlanta-georgia/">Astro on Tap Atlanta</a>, which is a satellite of the broader <a href="https://astronomyontap.org/about-us/">Astro on Tap</a> initiative. These monthly events bring in 50-75 adults from around the metro Atlanta to a local tavern to hear about astronomy, and has become the tavern's most popular recurring event.
<br>
<br>
		<!--Since the fall of 2021, I have also been the co-representative for the Department of Physics and Astronomy's Publicity & Outreach committee. This appointment goes hand-in-hand with my involvement in GOT Space, as I oversee and coordinate outreach efforts that are administered by or to the department.-->

		GOT Space was awarded a $30,000 grant to host <a href="https://physics-astro.gsu.edu/astropalooza-2025/">AsTropaLooza: An Astronomy of ATL Showcase</a>, which was a 4-day event that occurred in June 2025. As a Co-I of this proposal, my primary responsibilities involved coordinating the various parties of volunteers and participating institutions, communicating with interested Atlanta-area educators, designing our publicity materials, and facilitating the activities themselves. We engaged hundreds of K-12 children over these events, and intentionally worked to make AsTropaLooza accessible to underserved communities by providing $100 rideshare vouchers upon request to several families.

  
  <br>
  <br>

  I also have a passion for teaching, which I've been able to nurture during my time at GSU. I have TA'd a total of 15 introductory astronomy lab classes since my matriculation in Fall 2020, over which time I've been able to grow my skills as an educator, especially towards non-majors. Oftentimes, the quest for good grades can put students at odds with their physical or mental health, or with other obligations such as family care or work. I've spent a lot of time crafting policies for my lab classes that don't require students to make sacrifices, meaning they can prioritize their immediate needs and still succeed in the lab class. 
<br>
<br>
  For the Fall 2025 semester, I am the instructor of record for one class of ASTR 1010: Astronomy of the Solar System, and introductory class for non-majors. I chose to pursue this oportunity to further strengthen my pedagogical and organizational skills within an academic context, and as I move forward throughout my career, I intend to continue to learn and grow as an educator with an emphasis on accessibility for all.
